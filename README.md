# Tim's Code Repository

Welcome to my personal coding practice repository. 

You can expect to find the following in this repository:
- Coding practice: `uva-online-judge`
- Code skeleton: `code-skeleton`
- Coding notes

The code that I wrote here are meant as a practice for my self. It does not come with any sort of warranty, and is definitely not the most efficient, and might not be the best way or in accordance to a regular coding norm. 

Hope you still find it useful in some ways though!
