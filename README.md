# Tim's C Repository

Welcome to my personal coding practice repository. 

You can expect to find the following in this repository:

- Coding practice for Taiwan CPE, and Taiwan GPE exam in the  `cpe-problem`, and `gpe-problem` folder.
- Code skeleton for various simple task in the `other` folder.
- Notes for the things that I find useful in the `notes` folder.
- Tutorial for envirornment, IDE, and maybe other setup in the `tutorial` folder.
- The `stash` folder is for older project, unfinished project and maybe other files that I haven't got to organize yet.

The code that I wrote here are meant as a practice for my self. It does not come with any sort of warranty, might not be the most efficient, and might not be the best practice or in accordance to a regular coding norm. 

Hope you still find it useful in some ways though!
