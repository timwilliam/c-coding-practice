# Tim's C Repository

Welcome to my personal coding practice repository. 

You can expect to find the following in this repository:

- Coding problems from UVA Online Judge in `uva` folder.
- Code for problems in the realms of loop and recursive in the `loop-and-recursive` folder.
- Code for problems related with data structure in the `data-structure` folder.
- Code for problems related with sorting in the `sorting` folder.
- Code for various problem and or task in the `other` folder.

The code that I wrote here are meant as a practice for my self to get better at programming. It does not come with any sort of warranty, might not be the most efficient, and might not be the best practice or in accordance to a regular coding norm. 

Hope you still find it useful in some ways though!

Cheers,
timwilliam
